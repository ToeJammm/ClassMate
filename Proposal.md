## Introduction

Our project is a web application that allows students to rate and review their classes. This application will allow students to see what classes are like before they take them. This website will provide both reviews from students as well as an average difficulty level. This will allow students to make more informed decisions about their classes, and will allow them to have a better experience in their classes. We will plan to make this UTK-specific.

## Customer Value

We provide the value of information about classes to students. This way, with this knowledge, students can better prepare for their classes or decide if taking the class is worth it.
