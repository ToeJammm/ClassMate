## Introduction

Our project is a web application that allows students to rate and review their classes. This website takes inspiration from RateMyProfessor, but we made it for specific classes instead of professors. Since professors can teach multiple classes, each of varying difficulty, we made it so that students can rate the class instead of the professor. This will allow students to see what classes are like before they take them, and it provides both reviews from students as well as an average difficulty level, allowing students to make more informed decisions about their classes. Thus, students will have a better experience in their classes, as they know what they are about to get into. We have done the most development towards adding data for UTK, but we have functionality for other schools as well.

## Customer Value

There were no changes made to this from the Proposal to now.

## Technology

We used a React framework for a frontend and a Node.js and MSSQL backend. We ended up using MSSQL to communicate with a Microsoft Azure Database, and we had to use Firebase for a user setup, as there were many security functions built into Firebase. We did not end up using Python for data analysis nor the Docker container as much as expected. We ended up just using SQL and JS for any analysis we did, and we only used the Docker container to make sure that we could get our project to work on one machine to use universally. We ended up deploying the website using Vercel, which was different than what we initially started with. 

In the proposal, the main issue we forsaw involved making the website dynamic, user-friendly, and secure, as we can have users edit and add data to the website. This is still a big issue we ended up having, and to fix this, we needed to do extensive testing to ensure that users only have a limited range of what they can put in (such as a use of dropdowns, character limits, and parameterized SQL queries).

(Which technologies worked and which technologies didn't work? I would talk about Heroku, Azure VM services, MySQL, etc. here)

(What tests have we run? Results?)

## Team

We ended up having two members, Ryan Peruski and Gabe Carson, handle the backend and the database, while the other two members, Jake Marlow and Chris White, dealt with the frontend, design, and UX. Over time, team members strayed from contributing equally, and two of the four members ended up leading the group more.

## Project management

Overall, we feel that we have completed all of our goals from this project.

(Expand on this more. Maybe talk about what we thought we would get done vs. what actually got done, although I think we did more than what we initially expected. Some of this can maybe roll over into the reflection section)

## Reflection

-- Sprint 1: 
-- Sprint 2:
-- Sprint 3:
-- Sprint 4: 

We believe this project ended up being a complete success. Although we took almost the entire semester getting to a "Minimum Viable System" as defined in the initial proposal, that was because we did not rush to get the minimum done. Instead, we spent more time in building up a foundation for a bigger and clearer web app, and we believe that this paid off in the long run.
